@page install-as-part Install as part of project

One way to install the project is to make it part of your project scope,
just as if it's another file.

This has some advantages and disadvantages.

Copy the ``include`` folder off
[the repository](https://github.com/markhj/cpp-bbunit),
and put the files where you want them.

Make sure the files can be included, and now you should be ready to use C++ BBUnit.
