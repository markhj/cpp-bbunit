# C++ BBUnit

**C++ BBUnit** is a light-weight header-only unit testing library.

The "BB" stands for "black box", as in: When an aircraft crashes, you retrieve data from the black box.

The fact that it coincides with Star Wars and Death Stranding lore is a happy coincidence.

In these docs you'll learn to how to install and operate the library in your app.
