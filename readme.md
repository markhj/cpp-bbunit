# C++ BBUnit

**C++ BBUnit** is a light-weight header-only unit testing library, inspired
by JUnit and PHPUnit.

## Introduction :wave:

C++ BBUnit offers:

- Palette of common assertions (equal, not equal, greater than, less than)
- Regular expression patterns to test strings
- Test for thrown exceptions, including class type and message contents

To learn about installing and operating the library, check the documentation at: https://cpp-bbunit.readthedocs.io

## Production usage :guardsman:

This library is still in early development and lacks field-testing.
It's **_not_** recommended to use it for other purposes than educational,
experimentation and exploration.

## CMakeLists.txt :page_with_curl:
The included ``CMakeLists.txt`` compiles an executable which 
tests the library itself.
