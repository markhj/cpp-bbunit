**C++ BBUnit** is a light-weight header-only unit testing library, inspired
by JUnit and PHPUnit.

## ðŸŒ¿ Features

C++ BBUnit offers:

-   Palette of common assertions (equal, not equal, greater than, less than)
-   Regular expression patterns to test strings
-   Test for thrown exceptions, including class type and message contents

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

-   C++ 20 or higher
-   CMake 3.26 or higher

## ðŸ“˜ Documentation

To learn about installing and operating the library,
check the documentation at: https://cpp-bbunit.readthedocs.io

## ðŸš§ Production usage

This library is still in early development and lacks field-testing.
It's **_not_** recommended to use it for other purposes than educational,
experimentation and exploration.

## ðŸ“œ CMakeLists.txt
The included ``CMakeLists.txt`` compiles an executable which 
tests the library itself.
