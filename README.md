**C++ BBUnit** is a light-weight header-only unit testing library, inspired
by JUnit and PHPUnit.

## üåø Welcome to BBUnit 2!

**_C++ BBUnit 2_** presents a total overhaul of the library, bringing not
only new features, but also a safer and more flexible way of testing.

### Keep your app in check!

The more complex a project grows, the higher the risk of a change in one
place, breaking something in another.

This is where unit and feature testing come in, and make your life a lot
easier. Start covering your code, today!

### Header-only library

Very easy to integrate in your project, and no need to deal with building
and linking. Just ``#include`` and you're good to go!

### Compare (almost) any data type

With the introduction of a new template-based assertion system, you
can compare almost any data type. It's as simple as:

````c++
assertEquals<float>(expected, actual);
````

And what about classes? If you find yourself frequently asserting
things about classes, just make sure they have a comparison overloader,
and they can be checked by BBUnit.

### Size, exceptions and regex

But it doesn't stop there. You can also:

- Assert sizes of any data type which offers ``size`` method (vector, map, array, etc.)
- Assert that exceptions are thrown and which type
- Assert regular expression patterns on string-types

### Reporting

The reporting system is more detailed, and miles ahead of the legacy library
in terms of providing information about _where_ the problem arose.

What you want to see, though, is:

### Safe environment

Unintended behaviors, mainly exceptions, are caught and managed, without crashing
the test suite.

### Improved code

On the code-level, there's greater decoupling between test suite components, and
a much improved structure.
