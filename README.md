**C++ BBUnit** is a light-weight header-only unit testing library, inspired
by JUnit and PHPUnit.

## üåø Welcome to BBUnit 2!

**_C++ BBUnit 2_** presents a total overhaul of the library, bringing not
only new features, but also a safer and more flexible way of testing.

BBUnit offers:

- **Header-only library**: Very easy to integrate in your project
- **Compare almost any data type**: Make assertions on any data type that has comparable properties
- **When size matters**: Assert sizes of any data type which offers ``size`` method (vector, map, array, etc.)
- **Exceptional exceptions**: Assert that exceptions are thrown, and which
- **^regexp?$**: Assert regular expression patterns on string-types
- **Safer test environment**: Unintended behaviors are caught and managed, and won't crash the test suite
- **Better scoping**: It's much easier to know which test cases are failing

On the code-level, there's greater decoupling between test suite components, and
a much improved structure.
